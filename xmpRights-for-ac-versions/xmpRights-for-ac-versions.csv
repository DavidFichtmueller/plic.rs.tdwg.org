'Unknown' is an acceptable value, but 'Public Domain' is not.","Some providers use dc:publisher for this purpose, but it seems doubtful that the publisher is by necessity the copyright owner. 'Public Domain' is not an appropriate value because it denotes something that is not under copyright. In this case, omit or leave empty xmpRights:Owner, and put 'Public Domain' in the Copyright Statement (dc:rights). Except for 'Public Domain' resources, it is strongly urged that this field be supplied.",http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#Property,http://rs-test.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/attributes/Attribution,,1,No,No,Owner

Information on a collection applies to all contained objects unless the object has a different statement.,"Example: ""Available under Creative Commons BY-SA 3.0 license"". This also describes the commercial availability of items. Buying an identification tool or media resource is essentially the purchase of an individual license. Examples for such License statements: ""Available through bookstores"" for a commercially published CD, and ""Individual licenses available for purchase"" for a high-resolution image. Note that the medium or low resolution levels of the same image may be available under open access licenses. In general, this term determines the default licensing for the media. License terms specific to variants or representations of the media resource (e.g., different resolutions) are dealt within the section on Service Access Point Vocabulary",http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#Property,http://rs-test.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/attributes/Attribution,,1,No,No,UsageTerms

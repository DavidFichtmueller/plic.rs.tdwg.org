Examples: ""Copyright XY 2008, all rights reserved"", ""Â© 2008 XY Museum"", ""Public Domain."", ""Copyright unknown."" Do not place just the name of the copyright holder(s) here!

At least one of dcterms:rights and dc:rights must be supplied but, when feasible, supplying both may make the metadata more widely useful. They must specify the same rights.

Values may be used either in their literal form, or with a full namespace (e. g. from a controlled vocabulary, but the best practice is to use the literal form when using dc:type and use dcterms:type when you can supply the URI from a controlled vocabulary and implementers may require this practice.

The values of each should designate the same type, but in case of ambiguity dcterms:type prevails.","A Collection should be given type ""Collection"" when using dc:type. If the resource is a Collection, this item does not identify what types of objects it may contain.

## 1 Introduction

This document contains all versions of terms used in the history of the making of this most recent version of the Chronometric Age vocabulary (http://rs.tdwg.org/version/chrono/2020-MM-DD). The vocabulary uses the namespace abbreviation `chrono:`. Some terms are deprecated and should no longer be used, and some terms have been superseded with updated versions that better represent community understanding of the definitions and usage. Deprecation and supersession are noted in the term metadata. Some terms use a namespace (http://zooarchnet.org/dwc/terms/version/) that predates the standard. Metadata about those terms should not be expected to be retrievable by dereferencing their IRIs.

For a simplified list that contains only the currently recommended terms, see the Chronometric Age Quick Reference Guide (https://chrono.tdwg.org/terms/).

### 1.1 Status of the content of this document

In Section 4, the values of the `Term IRI`, and `Definition` are normative. The values of `Term Name` are non-normative, although one can expect that the namespace abbreviation prefix is one commonly used for the term namespace.  `Label` and the values of all other properties (such as `Notes` and `Examples`) are non-normative.

### 1.2 RFC 2119 key words
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119).

## 2 Use of Terms

The terms in this standard are meant to provide stable definitions that can be used in a variety of contexts, but were envisioned principally to function together as an extension to Darwin Core, where each core record may be annotated by one or more chronometric ages.

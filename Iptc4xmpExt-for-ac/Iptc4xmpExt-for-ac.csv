Terms from various controlled vocabularies may be used. AC-recommended vocabularies are preferred and may be unqualified literals (not a full URI).

It is recommended that the Location Shown field above always be used when known. However, in the case of position data automatically recorded by the instrument (e. g. EXIF GPS data) Location Created should be used to maintain information accuracy. When one but not both of these locations are present, AC is silent about whether the provided one entails the other.
